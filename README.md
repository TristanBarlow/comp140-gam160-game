### **Overview**
Suh dude will be a game about surfing. Somehow you’ve managed to catch a tidal wave set on destroying the coast of cornwall, you must use your immense skills to weave a safe path through all the debris in your way not doing so will leave you dead!

### **Mechanics**
The core mechanics will have you leaning left or right on your surfboard(controller) to dictate the path of your wave. It will be a 2d vertically scrolling game.

The longer the time spent on the wave the more ‘Gnarly’ (points) your wave will be. This allows  you to challenge your friends to “who can get a Gnarlier wave?” 

To make staying on the wave a challenge the player will face obstacles. These may include but are not limited to: cars, buildings, seagulls, tourists and rocks.  Colliding with obstacles will make you lose balance, this could be thought as health. 

The player will also make their wave more Gnarly by carving(going left to right) on it, but they will a greater risk of collision if doing so.

When you lose your balance you will be swallowed by the wave and the player will have to restart.

Not all encounters to the player will be negative. There will also be positive pickups. These will do a variety of things like give you a Gnarly multiplier, or restore some balance.

There will also be the ability to jump which will cost balance but give you a invunrability whilst in the air, this will be play tested to see if it fits with the game concept.

## **Controller**

### **Design**
The physical body of the controller will either be a skateboard. The reason behind using a skateboard rather than a surfboard is the easy of transportation. The controller will need to be portable and a surfboard may be too cumbersome . The feel of a skateboard will be similar if not the same and hopefully will not break the immersion. To steer the player will lean right or left, to translate this movement into something something meaningful in unreal I will use a potentiometer. The poteniometer will be fixed on a stand with the skateboard deck, the poteniometer unlike the skateboard will be fixed in place. My plan is to have the skateboard being fixed to some metal piping which then rests in the stand. I forseer just the exercise of balancing on my controller to be entertaining. Although this may make less accsessible for some consumers. This controller may not be accessible for some with physical disabilites and those with poor balance. In addition I will play test a jump feature in my game, this will be physically manifested as a button on the tail of the skateboard.

### **Reasearch**
From the research I have done there are no exsisiting game controllers that take the form of a surfboard/skateboard that are desinged to be "used for a surfing game. This being said, there was a controller developed for the game called "tony hawk: ride". This game was a commercial failure by all accounts, with an average score of 45% across Xbox360 and Playstation 3 from Metacritic.
The physical challenge of balancing I believe will add another layer of challenge to my game. Following this line of thought I looked into the [Indo Board](http://indoboard.eu/en/). Unlike the already mentioned game the indo board has been and continues to be a commercial succsess. Hopefully by blending the two aspects of game and physcial challenge I can provide a fun and entertaining service.
